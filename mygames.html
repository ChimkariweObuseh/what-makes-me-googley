                This was the very first game I ever made. It doesn't look like much, but it was the game that introduced me to the world of coding! I'm very grateful for that. The game has no story, is pretty confusing, and has some seriously unbalanced gameplay, but, uh, have fun!

                I made this game for my siblings, because we're all huge fans of Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts. The gameplay is not tremendous, the instructions are unneccessarily confusing, and the characters seem really rushed, but as for the time, this was easily some of the best pixel art I'd ever made.

                This is a ripoff version of RobTop's Geometry Dash. Again, my version of this game is not incredible, but a lot of dedication and work went into this game in order to making it seem similar to the actual game. Besides, I was just having fun...

                This was very hard to make. I remember getting help from some YouTube videos for this game, and even now it still doesn't feel perfected. I think I was transitioning from an intermediate programmer to an advanced programmer when I made this. Sometimes I wonder how I sat through making it. But then again... I'm making a website.

                Wait, I made a second one? Yes, yes I did. I named this level "Path of Pain", probably just because I'm really bad at naming things. It's way harder than the first level, to the point that the gameplay just irritates people, so, I don't really talk about this one very much.

               This is when I started going big. I made this game for Sickle Cell Awareness Day 2023 and brought it to my local hospital on the day. It was a huge success, and really got me thinking about Game Developement or Computer Science as a whole for a career.

                OK, I know what you're going to say. This isn't actually a game. And you're right. It just looks so good though, so I simply HAD to add it in. Seriously though, just show that to someone who's not feeling well, click, and they're all better.

This game is based around the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game, and provides a made-up story and explanation behind it. I think you'll like this one!

                So, this was the very first game series I ever made. It's also my only game series so far. The series has a lot of story, and you can slowly see me getting better at coding as you progress through the series. I started this game series moments after making Skeleton Scramble, and finished just before making the Sickle Cell Awareness Day Project. The series is about-- &emsp; OK, I'm just joking. I wouldn't spoil it for you.
