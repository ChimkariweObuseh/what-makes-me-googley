        <p>
            As I said on the home page, Google Doodles are one of the most inspiring things I've ever come across. I seriously don't even know how you do it. The small Google Doodles, like The Scoville Game, are so quick, yet so lovable. The big Google Doodles, like the Doodle Champion Island Games, you can almost tell before you even play it that so much work went behind it (if possible during the program I would love to see the behind the scenes of Google Doodles). Here are some Google Doodles that <i>really</i> got me into coding.

            COVID-19 LOCKDOWN
        </H1>
        <p>
            During 2020 to 2021, I got bored because of Lockdown. I tried Chess (makes you look smart), Astronomy (quite fascinating, actually) and a bit of coding because I thought it would be too hard (it wasn't). I also played Geometry Dash, which I think you would know after I tried to <strong style="background-color: rgb(116, 156, 83); border-radius: 5px;"><a href="mygames.html">remake it</a></strong>. More importntly, my enjoyment in coding only grew from there. I still really enjoy Chess and Astronomy too,

        HOW I CAME TO MAKING THE WEBSITE:

    <h1>
        FIRST IDEAS
    </h1>
    <p>
        When we were first told to make something "Googley" for the OneWeekAtGoogle program, I was so lost. I didn't know what it meant. I mean I probably still don't <i>completely</i> know what it means, but at the time, I was so confused, I was literally just going to send a 500 word essay and be done (Side note: This doesn't count as an essay, right? Because I'm WAY over 500 words). However, after a little talk with a relative, I knew I could do more. Much more. I didn't expect a <strong>full-website</strong>, but I knew it wasn't the end.
    </p>
    <h1>
        BEING GOOGLEY 
    </h1>
    <p>
        So first I started researching what it truly meant to be Googley. I looked at all the links, and Googled a bit more. After reading it all, I thought, "Huh, I actually am Googley!" I just needed to find a way to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a while, it clicked - I knew what I was going to make. It would be one of my biggest projects so far. I didn't know if I was ready, after all the years of learning on my own. It was the best idea I'd had... I was going to make a website!
    </p>
    <h1>
        MAKING THE WEBSITE
    </h1>
    <p>
        At first it felt a bit extreme, but I suddenly realised how perfect it was. It would show that I'm keeping an eye on the goals, striving for excellence, going the extra mile and that I have a really good sense of humour (all things that make you Googley). It was hard at first, but I learned SO MUCH during the time of making the website.

        CONCLUSION
    </h1>
    <P>
        So, that's it! I hope this website showed you that I'm a Googley person. I tried really hard to make this incredible, and I've been working on it for about a week, maybe a bit more. It really was a lot of fun, and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed making it!
